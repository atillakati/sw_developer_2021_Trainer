## Create a shared folder with Raspberry PI
You will need a shared folder between your development system (e.g. Windows) and the Rasperry PI OS to be able to exchange files (docker-compose.yaml) between them.

## Installing portainer/portainer-ce

```
docker pull portainer/portainer-ce
```
Start the portainer container with following settings:
```
docker volume create portainer_data
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce
```
After starting the service, you have a graphical UI for maintain docker. Goto url http://{ip address}:9000/.
